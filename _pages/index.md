# ACML 2022

The 14th Asian Conference on Machine Learning (ACML 2022) will take place at Hyderabad, India on November, 2022 in a hybrid mode. The conference aims to provide a leading international forum for researchers in machine learning and related fields to share their new ideas, progress and achievements. Submissions from regions other than the Asia-Pacific are also highly encouraged.

The conference calls for high-quality, original research papers in the theory and practice of machine learning. The conference also solicits proposals focusing on frontier research, new ideas and paradigms in machine learning. ACML has taken place annually since 2009 in locations throughout the Asia-Pacific region.
