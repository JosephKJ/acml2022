title: Call for Tutorials
---

We invite proposals for tutorials on machine learning and related areas, to be given online as a part of ACML 2021 on November 17, 2022. A tutorial should be of interest to a wide ACML audience, provides a basic introduction to the area including its theoretical and practical implications, and covers recent advances on the chosen subject. Presentations that focus exclusively on the presenter's own work or commercial demonstrations are strongly discouraged. Each tutorial is approximately 2.5 hours, including time for breaks.

More information to be given soon.
