title: Call for Workshops
---

The ACML 2022 organizing committee invites proposals for workshops to be held virtually along with the conference on Nov. 17-20, 2022.

The conference aims at providing a leading international forum for researchers in machine learning and related fields to share new results, ideas and discuss emerging topics.

We invite proposals for workshops on machine learning and related fields. Joint tutorial-workshop proposals are also highly encouraged (see also call for tutorial proposals, for additional details). The proposals could focus on showcasing “original research”
 from the Asian subcontinents. Submissions from under-represented groups/regions are especially welcome.

More information to be given soon.
